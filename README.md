# Deep Learning Specialization

In this repository you find samples of the activities for the [Deep Learning Specialization of DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). Under the previous links you can find the syllabus of the program and more information about it.

The ethical code for this specialization does not allow the publication of code. Therefore the code has been compiled/packed for you to be able to clone the repo and run this on your own LINUX machine (an up to date distribution should make it with no issues). Each folder in this repository corresponds to a programming  assignment in this specialization. There you find an executable file and if required other data necessary for the execution. Specific details are given in the respective README files in the folders.

Have fun!
